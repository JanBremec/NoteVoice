Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.
More specifically, people can:
- perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
- contribute to the Web

Accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:
- auditory
- cognitive, neurological, and speech
- physical
- speech
- visual

The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops standards and support materials to help you understand and implement accessibility.
